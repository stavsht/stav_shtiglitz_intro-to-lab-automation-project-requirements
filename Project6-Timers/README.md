# Project 6: LED turns ON for 5 seconds on button press - the use of timers in Arduino

1. Understand the use of timers in Arduino and problems that they can solve

## Write a program that does the following:
- Turn on an LED on pin 4 when a button is pressed using interrupts
- The LED should turn off after 5 seconds
- Do not use a delay() function here. Please use the system clock to measure the time. look for the millis() function in the Arduino reference.
Test the code and make sure it works as expected

## update the code to add a delay in the loop function
- Add the same for loop as in the previous exercise to simulate a long process. Does the LED still turn off after 5 seconds? Why or why not?
answer here: __No, because it blocks the loop() from running quickly enough to check the time. So even though 5 seconds have passed in real time, the code hasnâ€™t reached that line yet to turn the LED off.________

## Write a second program. The proper way to solve this problem is to use a timer
- install package mstimer2 from the library manager
- read the readme file of the package and note the package limitations
- open an example of the package, examine the code and its functions and how to use them.
- implement a timer to turn off the LED after 5 seconds
- note the callback in the timer. When is it called? The callback = turnOffLED(), It is called 5 seconds after MsTimer2::start() is run

## Exercises
- check that although the delay of 1 second is still in the loop function, the LED now turns off after 5 seconds

- change the LED time ON from 5 seconds to 30 ms, measure in the scope the time the LED is ON. is it 30 ms? Why or why not?
answer here: ______Yes, because it adds a 1-second pause after printing 1000 calculating... messages (in the loop function), so it's not interfering with the timer.
